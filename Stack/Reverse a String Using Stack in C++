//This repository contains a C++ program that demonstrates how to reverse a string using the stack data structure. The program iterates through the string, pushing each character onto the stack. Then, it pops the characters from the stack to construct the reversed string. The stack's LIFO (Last In, First Out) property ensures that the string is reversed efficiently.

Features:
Reverses a string by utilizing the stack data structure.
Pushes each character of the string onto the stack.
Pops characters from the stack to form the reversed string.
