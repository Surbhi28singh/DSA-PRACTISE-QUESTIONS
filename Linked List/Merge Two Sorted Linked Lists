//This repository contains a C++ implementation for merging two sorted singly linked lists into a single sorted list. The solution efficiently combines the two lists by comparing the nodes' data and linking them in ascending order.

Key Features:
Merging Sorted Lists: The core functionality merges two sorted linked lists, ensuring that the merged list maintains a sorted order.
Efficient Solution: The implementation uses a constant amount of extra space (apart from the input lists) and processes each node exactly once, making it optimal with O(m + n) time complexity.
Edge Case Handling: The algorithm handles cases where either of the lists is empty.
How It Works:
The solution uses a solve() function that:

Takes two sorted linked lists (first and second) as input.
Merges them into a single sorted list by comparing the node values one by one.
The merged list is returned with the smaller node values appearing first.
The sortTwoLists() function handles edge cases where one of the lists might be empty and invokes the solve() function to merge the lists.

Usage:
Initialize two sorted linked lists.
Call the sortTwoLists() function to merge the two lists.
The merged list will be returned as a new sorted linked list.
