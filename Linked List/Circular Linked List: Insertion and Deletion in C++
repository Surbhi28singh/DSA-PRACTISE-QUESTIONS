Explanation of the Code:
Node Class:

The node class represents each node in the circular linked list.
It has a constructor to initialize the node with data and a destructor to ensure proper memory cleanup by deleting any subsequent nodes.
InsertNode Function:

This function inserts a new node after a node with a given value (element).
If the list is empty (tail == NULL), a new node is created and points to itself, forming a circular linked list.
Ndelete Function:

This function deletes a node with a specific value from the list.
It handles three cases: deleting the only node in the list, deleting a node that is the tail, and deleting a node in the middle of the list.
Print Function:

This function prints the entire circular linked list starting from the tail node.
It loops through the list and prints each node's data until it circles back to the tail node.
Main Function:

The main() function tests the functionality by inserting nodes and printing the list after each insertion and deletion.
GitHub Repository Description:
Repository Name: Circular Linked List in C++

Description: This C++ program demonstrates the implementation of a circular linked list. The circular linked list has the following key features:

Node structure: Each node contains an integer value and a pointer to the next node.
InsertNode function: This function inserts a new node after a node with a specific value, allowing nodes to be added dynamically to the list.
Ndelete function: This function deletes a node with a specific value from the list, handling cases such as deleting the tail or the only node in the list.
Circular behavior: The list is circular, meaning the last node points back to the first node.
Memory management: The program ensures proper memory management by using a destructor that recursively deletes nodes when they are no longer needed.
Usage:

The program initializes an empty circular linked list.
It inserts nodes with given values.
It prints the list to show the current state after each insertion.
It deletes nodes and prints the list after each deletion.
How to Run:

Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
Run the executable to see the operations on the circular linked list.
